# EMCP Cloud Infrastructure Engineer Home Task 🚀

A production-ready NestJS backend service template designed for cloud-native deployment.

---

## 📋 Description

This project provides a baseline NestJS backend service. Your challenge is to deploy this application to the cloud using modern **GitOps**, **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, and **cloud-agnostic** best practices.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- Cloud provider account (AWS / GCP / Azure)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

Deploy this NestJS application to your cloud provider of choice while ensuring the infrastructure is **cloud-agnostic** and can be migrated to any cloud or on-premises environment.

---

## 📦 Task Requirements

### Part 1: Use This Template

1. Click **"Use this template"** to create a new repository
2. Clone your new repository locally
3. All infrastructure code should be added to your fork

---

### Part 2: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

Create Terraform configurations to provision the infrastructure needed to run this application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The infrastructure must be designed to be **cloud-agnostic** - meaning it should be portable across AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-premises with minimal changes.

---

### Part 3: GitOps CI/CD Pipeline

Implement a CI/CD workflow using **GitHub Actions**:

- Use GitHub repository secrets for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper environment management
- Ensure deployments are automated and repeatable

---

### Part 4: Cloud-Agnostic Design

Your solution **must** be portable. Consider:

- How would you switch cloud providers with minimal code changes?
- What abstractions would make migration easier?
- How do you handle cloud-specific services?

---

### Part 5: Documentation

Document your approach:

- Architecture decisions
- How to deploy
- How to migrate to a different cloud

---

## ⭐ Bonus: AI-Powered Testing & Safeguards

> [!TIP]
> Implementing these bonus features will strengthen your submission.

Consider adding:

- **Automated security scanning** in your CI pipeline
- **AI-powered code review** integration
- **Policy as Code** for infrastructure compliance
- **Automated testing** strategies
